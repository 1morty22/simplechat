## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription**: An active Azure subscription with Azure OpenAI, Cosmos DB, and Cognitive Search services enabled.
- **Azure App Service**: The application is deployed on Azure App Service. Ensure the service is available in your Azure environment.

### Initializing an Index in Azure AI Search Using the Azure Portal

The **Simple Chat Application** utilizes Azure AI Search for document retrieval. The `user-index.json` file contains the schema for creating the search index that will store user documents and metadata. Here's how to initialize the Azure AI Search index directly through the Azure portal using the `user-index.json` file.

#### Steps to Initialize the Index in the Azure Portal

1. **Access the Azure Portal**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the search bar at the top, search for **"Azure Cognitive Search"** and select your Azure AI Search resource.

2. **Navigate to Indexes**:
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Indexes** under the **Search Management** section.
   - Click on **+ Add Index from JSON**  to create a new index.

3. **Create Index from `user-index.json`**:
   - In the **Add Index from JSON** screen, you'll need to manually enter the index schema. Open the `user-index.json` file from the `artifacts/` folder in your project to view the schema, which includes fields, types, and configurations.
   
     ```
     üìÅ SimpleChat
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ artifacts
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user-index.json
     ```
   
4. **Copy and Paste from `user-index.json` file into the open menu on the right** 

7. **Verify Index Creation**:
   - After the index is created, go back to the **Indexes** section in Azure AI Search.
   - You should now see the new index listed (e.g., `simplechat-user-index`).
   - Click on the index to verify that all the fields are set up correctly.

### Setting Up Authentication for the Simple Chat Application

To secure access to the **Simple Chat Application**, we configure authentication using **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**. The app is registered in **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) to allow users to log in using their organizational credentials. Below are the steps for setting up authentication in **Azure App Service** and configuring the **Azure AD App Registration** for the application.

#### 1. **Enable Authentication in Azure App Service**

Authentication is enabled directly in the **Azure App Service** that hosts the application, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the app.

##### Steps to Enable Authentication:
1. **Access the Azure Portal**:
   - Open the Azure portal and navigate to the **App Service** hosting your application.
   - Under the **Settings** section, select **Authentication**.

2. **Add a Provider (Microsoft)**:
   - Click on **Add Identity Provider**.
   - Select **Microsoft** as the identity provider.
   - Under **App Registration**, choose the existing app registration or create a new one. In this case, the registration is **azgov-webapp-demo-chat-az**.
   - Set **Supported Account Types** to **Single tenant** to limit sign-ins to the current Azure AD tenant.

3. **Edit Authentication Settings**:
   - **Enabled**: Ensure that authentication is enabled.
   - **Restrict Access**: Set to **Require Authentication**. This ensures that only authenticated users can access the app.
   - **Token Store**: This feature is optional but enables storing tokens in the app service for authenticated users.
   - **Allowed External Redirect URLs**: You may specify external redirect URLs here if needed for your app flow.

##### Example Configuration:
- **App Registration Name**: `az-webapp-demo-chat`
- **Supported Account Types**: Current tenant - Single tenant
- **Application (client) ID**: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- **Client Secret Setting Name**: `MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`
- **Issuer URL**: `https://sts.windows.net/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/v2.0`
- **Allowed Token Audiences**: `api://000000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

4. **Configure Additional Authentication Settings**:
   - **Client Application Requirement**: Select **Allow requests only from this application itself**.
   - **Identity Requirement**: Configure based on your app‚Äôs needs, such as allowing only specific identities or the current tenant.

#### 2. **App Registration in Azure Active Directory**

The **App Registration** is where you define how users will authenticate against Azure AD when accessing your application.

##### Steps to Configure App Registration:
1. **Navigate to App Registrations**:
   - In the Azure portal, search for **App Registrations** under **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD).
   - Locate the registration for your app, e.g., `az-webapp-demo-chat`.

2. **Set Redirect URIs**:
   Under the **Authentication** tab in the app registration, configure the following URIs:
   - **Web Redirect URIs**:
     ```
     https://az-webapp-demo-chat.azurewebsites.us/getAToken
     ```
     This URI is used to handle the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and retrieve the authentication token.
   - **Front-channel Logout URL**:
     ```
     https://az-webapp-demo-chat.azurewebsites.us/logout
     ```
     This URL is used to log out users from the application and Azure AD session.

3. **Configure API Permissions**:
   - Under the **API Permissions** tab, ensure the app has at least the **User.Read** permission granted. This allows the application to access basic profile information of the signed-in user.

4. **Client Secret**:
   - In the **Certificates & Secrets** section, create a new client secret if needed and store the value securely. This secret is referenced as `MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET` in your app's environment variables.

#### 3. **Configure Enterprise Application Access (Users and Groups)**

Once authentication is set up, you can configure access controls using Azure AD‚Äôs **Enterprise Applications**. This allows you to manage which users or groups can sign in to your application.

##### Steps to Assign Users and Groups:
1. **Navigate to Enterprise Applications**:
   - In the Azure portal, go to **Enterprise Applications** under **Microsoft Entra ID**.

2. **Select the Application**:
   - Find the enterprise application created during app registration (e.g., `azgov-webapp-demo-chat-az`).

3. **Assign Users and Groups**:
   - Under the **Users and Groups** section, click **+ Add user/group**.
   - Search for and select the users or groups who should have access to the application.
   - Assign the appropriate role (if roles are defined in your app).

4. **Verify Access**:
   - Once the users and groups are assigned, they will be able to log into the application using their Azure AD credentials.

---

### Summary of Authentication Configuration

- **App Service Authentication**: Enable and require authentication through the Azure App Service settings, using **Microsoft** as the identity provider.
- **App Registration**: Set up redirect URIs for authentication and logout, and ensure permissions such as **User.Read** are granted.
- **Enterprise Application Users and Groups**: Assign specific users or groups to the enterprise application to control who can log into the app.

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your **Simple Chat Application** is secure and accessible only to authorized users via Azure AD.
